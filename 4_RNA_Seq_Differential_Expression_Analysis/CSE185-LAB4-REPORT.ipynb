    "# Lab 4: RNA-seq\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills: differential expression, basic R, enrichment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week you'll need to complete the following, which are described in more detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CSE185-LAB4-EXERCISES.ipynb` (20 pts)\n",

    "## Intro\n",
    "You would like to study the effects that eating a high fat diet might have on your health. To explore this, you perform an experiment using mice. You feed three mice a standard \"chow\" diet and another three mice a high fat diet (\"HFD\"). After 7 weeks, you collect liver biopsies from each of the six mice and perform RNA-sequencing. You'd like to analyze the RNA-seq results to determine which genes changed their expression, and what those genes might be doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline will consist of:\n",
    "1. Alignment of RNA-seq data and quantifying expression levels (we've already done that for you)\n",
    "2. Differential expression analysis\n",
    "3. \"GO\" Enrichment analysis to characterize differentially expressed genes.\n",
    "4. Visualizing expression data with IGV\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the data from this lab is from the paper [High fat diet-induced changes of mouse hepatic transcription and enhancer activity can be reversed by subsequent weight loss *Scientific Reports* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40220.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on new lab notebook format\n",
    "This week, we'll be transitioning to a new lab format which is no longer autograded and therefore a bit more open-ended. You'll be filling out the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CSE185-LAB4-REPORT.ipynb`: will provide instructions (and hints) about the analyses you'll be performing that week. It will have prompts for the questions you should answer. <font color=\"red\">This file is graded. The report is worth 70 pts (70%) of the points for this week's lab.</font> From here on out, we will not be asking you to paste specific commands you used to get your answer in the actual report. Instead, we will ask you to document your commands in the following file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CSE185-LAB4-README.ipynb`: We have included a mostly blank document for you. You should use this file to keep track of exactly the commands you used for each analysis, so that you can come back to it next week (or next year!) and remember what you did. <font color=\"red\">This file is graded. Documentation is worth 10 pts (10%) of the points for this week's lab.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional exercises in `CSE185-LAB4-EXERCISES.ipynb`. <font color=\"red\"> As usual exercises are worth a total of 20 pts (20%) for this week's lab.</font> You'll also see `CSE185-LAB4-PREPROCESSING.ipynb` with background information for how we performed the alignment and expression quantification steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of tools covered\n",
    "In this lab we'll be using the following tools and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) to access publicly available data.\n",
    "* [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) a genome browser. Used for visualizing RNA-seq alignments (and other types of genomic data)\n",
    "* [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) for differential expression analysis. This is an R package. It takes in gene expression levels across multiple replicates of multiple conditions and determines which genes are differentially expressed.\n",
    "* [PANTHER](http://www.pantherdb.org/) (or your tool of choice) for Gene Ontology analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also refer to these tools but will not run them directly:\n",
    "* [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) for aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference transcriptome.\n",
    "* [RSEM](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/) for quantifying gene expression. RSEM takes aligned reads as input and outputs expression levels for each gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Because DESeq2 is an R package, we'll be writing a small bit of R code. We'll point you to some resources to help you figure this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as usual, we'll do some plotting with the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python library (or, whatever method you want to use for plotting. You do not have to use matplotlib. You can also write R code directly in Jupyter notebooks as we'll see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of data provided\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, to save you time we have already precomputed part of the results you will need to complete the lab, which can be found in `~/public/lab4/`. You can read about the steps we used for this in `CSE185-LAB4-PREPROCESSING.ipynb`. We will go over how data was obtained from the paper and preprocessed in lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see:\n",
    "* `*.genes.results`: gene-level expression results output by RSEM for each condition/replicate.\n",
    "* `GRCm38.75.gene_names` contains a mapping between ENSEMBL gene ids (`ENSMUSG...`) and gene names (e.g. Cdc45, Klf6)"

    "Now that we have quantified gene expression in each of our samples, we can perform differential expression analysis.

    "I performed this differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package in R that was specificed in the lab 4 hints as well as above. The transcript-level abundance files were imported using tximport which was also a package that I imported following the guidelines that were provided. I also did the addition of a pseudocount to mitigate issues associated with genes having zero counts. Next, genes with low expression levels were filtered out to enhance the accuracy of the analysis, I chose a threshold of 8, somewhat arbitrarily however, I thought any number between the 5-10 range would be resonable as otherwise the expression levels are too low to get any credible results from their analysis (however, having been told we expected around 15000) I assumed I was on the right track. After all this, differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq function, and the results were obtained using the results function. Both non-significant and significant genes, determined by an adjusted p-value (the adjusted score) cutoff of 0.05, were written to separate CSV files. All of these choices, including adding pseudocounts, filtering low-expressed genes, and selecting a good p-value threshold, were made to ensure robust and reliable identification of differentially expressed genes while controlling for false discoveries\n",

    "All the key characteristics of the up-regulated and down-regulated make sense with high fat diet. Specifically, upregulated genes mainly cluster around biological processes associated with cholesterol and lipid metabolism, like cholesterol biosynthetic processes, lipid metabolic processes, and sterol biosynthesis. These findings align with expectations, this is because high-fat diets often lead to increased lipid intake and subsequent metabolic demands. The upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism shows an adaptive response to the elevated dietary fat intake, suggesting an increased need for lipid processing and storage. At the same time, downregulated genes are usually enriched in biological processes related to metabolic pathways such as arachidonic acid, xenobiotics, linoleic acid, and glutathione metabolism. This downregulation may show a reduction in inflammatory and detoxification processes. For example, the downregulation of genes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism suggests a dampened inflammatory response, while decreased xenobiotic metabolism gene expression may reduce the body's ability to metabolize and eliminate foreign substances. These findings show that there is a omplex interplay between dietary factors and metabolic regulation, where a high-fat diet may modulate gene expression to favor lipid metabolism while potentially compromising inflammatory and detoxification pathways."

Even if they have a large fold changes, the high variability associated with lowly expressed genes may mean that we have a wider confidence interval and lower statistical significance, which then leads to non-significant p-values. Examining the raw expression data, such as expression levels from RSEM, for these genes could provide insights into the underlying variability and help elucidate whether the observed changes are biologically meaningful or simply due to noise.

With more replicates, we can better estimate the true underlying distribution of gene expression levels and improve our ability to detect subtle changes in expression associated with experimental conditions. gene length indirectly affects statistical power through its impact on read counts and expression estimates. Regarding the second part of the question about gene length, longer genes typically produce more RNA transcripts. The means there is a higher read counts and increased statistical power to detect differential expression. This is because higher read counts provide more reliable estimates of gene expression levels and also make our ability to detect significant differences between experimental conditions alot better. However, there are naunces to gene length and power because longer genes may also have higher variability in expression due to their complexity and regulatory elements, which can reduce statistical power. Additionally, longer genes may require higher sequencing depth to accurately capture their expression profiles, which can increase experimental costs and computational burden."

    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to visualize our alignments, both to see that the alignment worked well, and also to see whether things we report as differentially expressed make sense. We'll use a genome browser called the Integrative Genomics Viewer, or IGV. In the process, we'll also see how to access data published with the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the web version of IGV: https://igv.org/app/ (or alternatively, download the desktop version which we actually prefer to use). Set the genome to (mm9), since according to the paper they had aligned reads to the mm9 reference genome (see page 11, \"Analysis of RNA, ChIP and DNase sequencing\"). Note, in our lab we aligned the data to the newer mm10/GRCm38 reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to orient yourself with IGV. It is basically like a Google Maps for genomes! The top gives the names of each chromosome. The bottom track, labeled \"Refseq genes\" gives the names and coordinates for all annotated genes. Let's choose one to look at. Type \"Fads2\" in the search box at the top. This will zoom the view in on this gene. Notice how in the gene you can see the exon and intron structure. The little arrows in the introns point to the left, which means this gene is on the reverse strand of the reference. Take a look at another gene (e.g. Fads3) to see a gene on the forward strand. Zoom in further (using the \"+\" at the top right) until you can see actual DNA sequence at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'd like to load our sequence alignments. While IGV can directly visualize BAM files, we'll instead look at \"counts\" files (\".bedgraph\" format. see http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html) which are much smaller. These give read counts per position (i.e. coverage) which can give us an idea of the abundance of each gene. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the paper have already provided data in bedgraph format. Head to the paper where we got the data: [High fat diet-induced changes of mouse hepatic transcription and enhancer activity can be reversed by subsequent weight loss *Scientific Reports* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40220.pdf). On page 12, you'll see a section \"Additional Information\" which contains information about where to access the raw data. If a paper generates new sequencing or other data types, they are usually required to make this information available. It will often be in a section labeled \"Data availability\" or something similar. We used the polyA RNA-seq, which you should find has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession GSE87565.\n",

    "Navigate again to Fads2 (This should be one of your differentially expressed genes!). Note that the RNA-seq tracks have very \"spiky\" coverage. Some regions have tons of reads and others are flat. Note how that compares to the structure of the gene annotated on the bottom. As expected, the \"spikes\" correspond to reads from exons, since intron and intergenic sequences generally aren't sequenced in our RNA-seq experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note of the y-axis range for each dataset (after you initially load them, it should range from 0 to a couple hundred for this gene). To make the tracks more comparable, you can set them all to have the same data range by using the \"settings\" icon to the left of each track and clicking \"set data range\". Try setting them all to 500. (the appropriate range will be different for different genes, since genes are really highly expressed whereas others are very lowly expressed. See the huge range on your scatterplot!) You should see that the gene is much more highly expressed in the HFD samples.\n",

    "<font color=\"red\">Note: the bedgraph files from GEO look a little weird (the coverage peaks are too wide), which may be the result of an extension step being applied. We also provided tdfs ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0uu5QSVgU3LSxybX50bDhGuv_vU2vTH?usp=sharing)) that we created from the aligned BAM files after we ran STAR. You can also visualize these using IGV, just be sure to change to the mm10 genome. Visualizations in the slides are based on these tdfs.</font>\n",
